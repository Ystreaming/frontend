# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

## Generate environments

Run `ng g environments` for generate environment files. 
Add the apiUrl variable in both environment files :
- src/environments/environment.ts
- src/environments/environment.development.ts

The environment files will look like :
`
export const environment = {
    apiUrl: '127.0.0.1:3000'
};
`


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
